            <h2>Michael Ward (Owner & Skipper)</h2>
            <p>
              Skipper Michael took over the running of trips for the 2024
              season, replacing Steve, his father, in the day-to-day running of
              the boat. He quickly proved himself to be a dab hand at catching
              octopi; proving that they indeed ‘have a bite’; these days he’s
              very careful when handling even the smallest octopus. Originally
              from Warwickshire, he moved up to Scotland at the beginning of the
              2024 season, expecting to be taken on as ‘relief skipper’. Highly
              qualified, he suddenly got thrown into the deep end when Steve
              couldn’t run the tours. For 2025, he has taken over the reins of
              the family business, securing the future of The Glass Bottomed
              Boat in Gairloch. If you have any questions, Michael’s your man.
              And if he doesn’t know the answer, he’ll find it out for you on
              your safe return to shore.

            <h2>Julie Ward (Administrator)</h2>
            <p>
              Julie has run the office and bookings side for four years. 2025
              will be her fifth year at the helm. And I do mean at the helm!
              Without her friendly face greeting and preparing the customers for
              what is to come, the whole caboodle would revert to chaos. She’s
              mainly to be found in ‘The Little Grey Hut’ (our booking office),
              but gets out on trips as often as possible, just to keep Michael
              on his toes. Maybe taking the helm while Michael, her son, answers
              questions or explains what you’re looking at. Originally from
              Warwickshire she moved to Suffolk and became a ‘round-Britain’
              sailor. You will be safe in her capable hands.

            <h2>Steve Ward (Relief-Skipper)</h2>
            <p>
              Skipper Steve, Julie’s husband and Michael’s dad, has taken a
              little bit of a back seat and assumed the role of relief skipper
              and relief administrator. But he will be seen at times, either
              running a trip or assisting either Michael or Julie. Everyone
              tells us he’s great with kids; that’s probably because he still is
              one. Again, from Warwickshire, he moved to Suffolk handling boats
              of all types before relocating to Scotland and taking over the
              business from its prior owner in 2022 (after a year working for
              him in 2021). His ‘unique’ sense of humour will certainly be known
              if he happens to be skippering the trip you’re on. You have been
              warned!

              Alice, the glass bottomed boat, is out on hardstanding undergoing
              repairs to be ready for the 2025 season. We wish all of our
              customers, both past and present, and those we’ve not had the
              pleasure to meet yet, a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

              Skipper Mike unfortunately diagnosed with stupidity syndrome. He

              in Gairloch. "It was like the kraken," he said!
